### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gavin. I'm a software engineer currently working mostly on backend stuff, though I can make a frontend if I must. 

This account is mostly side projects, experiments, and coding practice. Work account here -> [@gavinthebox](https://github.com/gavinthebox)

Fun facts about me:

- I have a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- I once won the [Dutch Aquascaping competition](https://showcase.aquatic-gardeners.org/2021/index3.html) put on by the Aquatic Gardener's Association
- If you want to check out some random tuturials and (relatively) concise ramblings about software engineering and other subjects, check out my [medium](https://medium.com/@gjcarew)
